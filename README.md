# Overview
This repository contains code for a machine learning regression problem focused on predicting the age of crustaceans based on a set of features.
The goal is to develop an accurate model that can generalize well to predict the age of crustaceans given specific input features.

# Model
GradientBoostRegressor

# Features
Sex - Gender of the Crustacean- Male, Female, and Indeterminate.
Measures - Contains the Length, Diameter, and Height of the Crustacean stored in a tuple.
Weights - Contains the weights of the Shell, Shucked, and Viscera.

# Target Variable
Age - Contains the Age of the Crustacean. This is the value that needs to be predicted..

# Evaluation
MSE : 4.90336
